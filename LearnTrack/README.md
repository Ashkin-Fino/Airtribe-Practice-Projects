1. Project Description:

LearnTrack is a console-based Learner Management System developed in Java.
The application allows management of Students, Trainers, Courses, Batches, and Enrollments using an in-memory repository.

The system provides functionality to:
    1. Add, search, and deactivate Students and Trainers
    2. Create Courses and Batches
    3. Enroll Students into Batches
    4. View lists such as all students, trainers, courses, and ongoing batches

The project is designed following basic Object-Oriented Programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, modular services, and repository-based storage.

2. Package and Class Structure:

3. How to run the application:

    Step 1: Clone the repository to your local device.

    Step 2: Use the following command to compile all .java files to .class files and place it inside bin folder.
        javac -d bin src/com/airtribe/learntrack/**/*.java

    Step 3: Then use the following command to run the compiled Main.class file.
        java -cp bin com.airtribe.learntrack.Main
    
    Or instead of step 3, you can create a executable jar and run it.
